-- This Project harnesses the backend of PayloadCMS for its shopping cart and product organization pages.
-- Install all the things
-- Create a user at localhost:3000/admin
-- DO NOT SEED THE PAYLOAD TEMPLATE IN THE DASHBOARD INSTRUCTIONS although it shouldn't have any effect on the code, it just is a bit pointless and annoying to clean up.
-- The header has been altered from the original, but still uses the CMS to load links into it.
-- The footer still works as expected
-- Categories should be created first
-- Pages should be created next to house the categories
-- All pages that are not product pages were created outside of the CMS
-- Stripe shipping was added to the project
-- An account dashboard was added
-- Editing types can have very unexpected outcomes, be sure to test site thoroughly after any changes to the types.
